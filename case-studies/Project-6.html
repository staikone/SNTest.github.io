  <h1>Enhancing Promotion Visibility in B2B Catalog</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Improving how discounts and quantity-based promotions are shown in product listings and product pages</p>
</header>

<section class="cs-intro">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In a B2B automotive parts catalog, promotional campaigns by quantity were hidden or confusing. The goal was to redesign how promotions are displayed on product listing pages (PLP) and product detail pages (PDP), so that users can quickly discover applicable offers and make informed purchasing decisions. I led UX + UI design, aligning with design systems and accessibility standards.
  </p>

<section class="cs-problem">
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Users often missed active promotions or didn’t understand tiered discounts. The original interface lacked clear visual cues, making it hard to compare discounted prices or know when a promotion applies. This ambiguity reduced conversion and hurt discoverability of offers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="cs-process">
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>
    I followed a user-centered design workflow to create the promotion visibility feature:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Research & Audit:</strong> Reviewed existing catalog UX, analyzed user pain points via support tickets, and benchmarked similar e-commerce systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Wireframes & Ideation:</strong> Sketched multiple layouts showing promotion badges next to prices and "Add to Cart" buttons, both for list and detail pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Iterations:</strong> Created high-fidelity mockups in desktop, tablet, and mobile views. Conducted micro-tests with internal stakeholders (product, operations) to validate clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>Usability Refinement:</strong> Tested hover tooltips and modals for campaigns with many tiers; adjusted interactions to ensure clarity and responsiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Localization Flexibility:</strong> Built optional custom fields for legal/regional campaign notes to adapt across markets.</li>
  </ol>

<section class="cs-solution">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    The final design adds a campaign icon next to product price & “Add to cart.” On desktop, hovering reveals details via a tooltip; for many promotions, a “Show all” modal appears. On mobile, tapping the icon opens a full-screen modal with campaign tiers and pricing. Visual badge, modal design, and interactions were designed to balance richness with speed.

<section class="cs-results">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sales increased by up to 20% in markets where the feature was deployed within 3 months.</li>
    <li>Internal operators processed orders more quickly and accurately thanks to clearer promotional visibility.</li>
    <li>Positive user feedback: users reported better clarity in understanding discounts.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="cs-learnings">
  <h2>Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    Because I had to respect an NDA, I couldn’t publish visuals from the live product initially—but I learned how to present strong case studies even under constraints. Next time, I’d integrate A/B testing early and capture quantitative UX metrics (click-through, engagement) during pilot rollout. In future projects, I’ll document those metrics in design deliverables to boost credibility.
