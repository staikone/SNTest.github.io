    <h2>Project Goal</h2>
    <p>To improve the way quantity-based promotions and discounts are displayed within the product catalog, 
      both on the product listing page (PLP) and individual product pages (PDP).  The primary objective was to 
      increase visibility and clarity of active campaigns, making it easier for users to discover applicable discounts, 
      thus stimulating sales and improving user experience.</p>

    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <p>* Designed the entire UX and UI for the feature from the ground up.
* Created a custom icon to visually identify products participating in promotional campaigns.
* Ensured the design was fully aligned with the existing design system and compliant with WCAG accessibility standards.
* Designed adaptive solutions for desktop, tablet, and mobile, optimized for the behavior of B2B users (mainly company operators working on desktop).
* Incorporated flexibility for different markets by enabling optional custom info fields per campaign.</p>

     <h2>UX Solution Overview</h2>
    <p>On Product Listing Page and Product Page:
* Products included in promotions are marked with a campaign icon next to the price and “Add to cart” button.</p>

     <h2>Desktop Behavior:</h2>
    <p>Tooltip on hover reveals campaign details:
* Discount tiers based on quantity purchased (e.g., buy 10+ get 15% off),
* Final price per unit depending on selected quantity.
* If a product is part of more than four promotions, a “Show all” button appears, opening a modal window with full campaign info.
</p>

     <h2>Mobile & Tablet Behavior:</h2>
    <p>* Tap on the icon opens a fullscreen modal, showing the same promotional information.
This approach was intentionally designed to maintain fast user flow on desktop, where most corporate users interact with the platform.</p>

     <h2>Localization Support</h2>
    <p>*To support different market needs, the system allows up to four additional customizable fields per campaign, used for legal notes, regional rules, or special terms.</p>

     <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>* Within the first 3 months post-implementation, markets where the feature was activated reported up to a 20% increase in sales.
* Users reported improved clarity in understanding quantity-based promotions.
* Internal operators were able to process orders faster and more accurately.
