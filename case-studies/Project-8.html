    <h1>Quick Search Categories Redesign</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Improving usability, layout, and visual feedback for a B2B parts catalog</p>
  </header>

  <section class="cs-intro">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In a B2B web platform for automotive aftermarket and OEM parts across multiple segments (light & heavy vehicles, marine, agricultural), the “Quick Search” landing page listing product categories was underperforming. The original layout wasted space and limited click targets. My role was to redesign the UI component from scratch, integrate it into the design system, and ensure accessibility across markets.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-problem">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The existing quick search categories interface forced users to hunt for clickable zones—only parts of each category tile were clickable, and visual feedback was minimal. On narrower screens, the layout broke or became clumsy. This ambiguity reduced usability and slowed navigation in a complex catalog.
    </p>

  <section class="cs-process">
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Audit & Usability Review:</strong> Evaluated current quick search layout, measured click zones, collected pain points from support logs and user feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Concept & Wireframes:</strong> Created multiple layout options showing full-tile click behavior, hover feedback, and adaptive grid systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Mockups & Specification:</strong> Designed clean visuals with retouched images, border cues, and hover expansion. Documented spacing, states, and interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive Adjustments:</strong> Defined behavior across desktop (up to 5 columns), tablet (2 columns), and mobile (single column) with touch-friendly zones.</li>
      <li><strong>Localization & Edge Cases:</strong> Tested dynamic text lengths, category variations across 22 markets, and adaptive behavior in different languages and contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Iteration & Feedback:</strong> Gathered stakeholder and user feedback, refined hover feedback, border expansion, and touch interactions.</li>
    </ol>

  <section class="cs-solution">
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      The redesigned quick search component displays category tiles that are fully clickable (not just the label). Each tile includes a crisp product image and clear title, enclosed by a border that expands by 3px on hover (desktop) to give visual feedback. On mobile/tablet, taps open a modal with full category information. The interface is integrated into the existing design system and styled to accommodate localization and accessibility.

  <section class="cs-results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Positive qualitative feedback from users across 22 markets.</li>
      <li>✅ Faster navigation to key categories by reducing cognitive friction.</li>
      <li>✅ Improved visual hierarchy and clarity in the catalog UI.</li>
      <li>✅ The redesign was adopted as a pattern for similar category pages.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="cs-learnings">
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      Because of confidentiality and NDA constraints, I could not share internal metrics or live screenshots. I learned how to present a case study compellingly even under constraints, using descriptions and mockups. In future projects, I will strive to capture measurable data (click-through rates, interaction times) during pilot releases and include them in the design narrative to strengthen credibility.
